As we now know well enough, understanding how our business is going and where it is going is the key
to success. This is even more the case when we offer subscription services or products.

Before getting to the heart of the matter, it is very important to recall certain concepts essential
to the proper understanding of the following reports:

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: MRR is arguably the most important metric for subscription
  businesses. Indeed, it shows the revenue earned with subscription-based products or services every
  single month. It is a consistent number that you can use to track all your recurring revenue over
  time, in monthly increments.

- **Annual Run-Rate (ARR)**: ARR is the yearly version of MRR. Based on the current MRR, you can estimate
  the coming year's performance with the Annual Run-Rate. However, this estimation does not take
  variations and growth into account.

- **Non-Recurring Revenue (NRR)**: NRR shows the revenue earned for everything else than subscription-based
  products or services. This includes gains of a rare or unique nature that are unlikely to occur in
  the ordinary course of businesses.

- **Customer Retention**: This concept consists of engaging existing customers to continue buying
  products or services from your business. As you may know, customer retention is quite a challenge
  because you must prove yourselves worthy of your customers' trust.

- **Churn Rate**: Also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, the churn rate can be defined,
  in this case, as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a
  given time period. We can distinguish two types of Churn:

  - **Logo Churn**: It corresponds to the subscription cancellation rate.

  - **Revenue Churn**: It corresponds to the monthly recurring revenue loss rate.

  .. note::
    Let's imagine an increase of 2$ on a service subscription.

   - We loss three customers out of the initial 20 which gives us a **Logo Churn** of 15%.

   - Therefore, the 56$ of MRR difference out of the initial 600$ gives us a **Revenue Churn** of 9,33%.

   As a reminder, though they seem to evolve in the same direction most of the time, it might not be
   the case all time.

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Very important measure which indicates how much revenue can be
  expected for a customer during his/her entire contract. This approach emphasizes the importance of
  customer retention, shifting our focus from a quarterly or yearly approach to a long-term vision.
